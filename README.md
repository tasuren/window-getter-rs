# window-enum-rs
This is a Rust library for retrieving information about the windows open on the OS.  
**It is not production ready yet.**

## ToDo
First release todos:
- [x] macOS
  - [x] Get all windows
  - [x] Window bounds
  - [x] Window title
  - [x] PID of owner that has Window
- [ ] Windows
  - [ ] Get all windows
  - [ ] Window bounds
  - [ ] Window title
  - [ ] PID of owner that has Window
- [ ] Linux?
  I have no plans to make this at this time due to my inexperienced knowledge about Linux.  
  But I'd be happy to receive pull requests.
